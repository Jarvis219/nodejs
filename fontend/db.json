      "content": "<h2>The Best Basics To Wear For Spring</h2><p>The key to having the perfect spring outfit is to start with good spring basics. If you have a solid wardrobe of essentials, youâll be able to mix and match with ease. Theyâll also provide a stylish spring outfit you can add accessories to. Here are a few pieces you should start with:</p><ul><li>The elevated t-shirt. For a piece that captures effortless cool, look for a t-shirt in a fabric such as neoprene or cashmere that will bring an extra touch of elegance to your outfit.</li><li>The light jacket. For chilly mornings and nights, a lightweight jacket is the ideal addition to your spring outfit. A trench coat is also a classic, but right now bomber jackets and denim jackets are trending for spring too.</li><li>The easy dress. A dress is an all-in-one spring outfit. Find one that has a relaxed but chic silhouette and all you have to do is throw it on the morning and go.</li><li>The cropped pant. Once an office classic and now an off-duty staple too, cropped trousers look relaxed but tailored too. Ideally youâd like a pair that sits at least mid waist and is cropped just above the ankle. Our favourite spring tip: you can wear it with heels and flats.</li><li>The perfect white trainer. Think weekend cool, rather than gym shoe. Favoured by the style crew for its off-duty cool, white trainers add a minimalist edge to spring outfits. Look for one in leather or sturdy canvas that has a slim silhouette and clean details.</li></ul><h2>How To Adapt Your Outfits From Winter To Spring</h2><p>Youâre probably so used to wearing heavy coats that you donât know what to do with the warmer weather. Read how we update our winter staples for spring outfits:</p><ul><li>Wear silk scarves instead of chunky knitwear. Choose one thatâs colourful and bright to tie around your neck, your wrist or your bag for a fun spring accessory.</li><li>Try a cotton sweater instead of wool. Not only will it be more comfortable, if it gets warm you can always channel preppy style and tie it around your shoulders for a relaxed spring look.</li><li>Wear a suede or denim coat instead of faux fur. Not only are these wardrobe classics the perfect cover up for spring weather, they also add an instant edge to any outfit.</li><li>Swap a turtleneck for a button down shirt. Swap the winter favourite for a piece thatâs just as crisp and polished, but that works better for the season. We like wearing a boyfriend style shirt with jeans or cropped pants and red lipstick.</li></ul><h2>This Seasonâs Best Spring Outfit Ideas</h2><p>For spring 2017 itâs all about mixing and matching trends and breaking the rules to find something that works for you. Here are some of our favourite outfit combinations:</p><ul><li>Sweater and midi skirt. Itâs not quite the end of sweater weather, so donât pack your knits away yet; but instead of wearing it with jeans, try a midi skirt instead. The polished silhouette will make your outfit look just that little bit more elegant; finish the outfit with heels and youâre good to go.</li><li>Cropped jeans and mules. Itâs the thinking ladyâs perfect pairing. Cropped jeans show off the ankles, while classy mules make the outfit look more polished. Itâs perfect for a night out.</li><li>Denim on denim. This combination used to be strictly off limits, but like we said earlier, the rules have gone out the window. We like to wear a denim button down shirt with vintage denim flares, topped off with a leather jacket to break it up.</li><li>An off the shoulder top and jeans. See a trend here? Itâs all about dressing up our favourite off duty pieces with something more ladylike, and a feminine off the shoulder top is a great way to make jeans more sophisticated.</li></ul><p>What are you planning to wear for spring?

In todayâs world of infinite choices, this is more relevant than ever. &nbsp;This year, winter style embraces experimenting with different personas, classic feminine figures and archetypes. Whether your flannel is a throwback to a simpler time, or you prefer to lounge in your best furs, this seasonâs fashion is sure to inspire new attitudes and perspectives.</p><ul><li>Oversized trench coats â Get swallowed up in a big, cozy trench for your daily go-to street look. Lighter neutrals such as taupe, beige, cream and heather grey are especially popular.</li><li>Cord â The scene is set with cord jackets, vests and skirts in navy blue, camel, mustard, burgundy and coffee brown. Black cord trousers are the perfect departure from your standard skinny jeans.</li><li>Shoulder Cut-Outs â We love the cut-out trend for its unexpected and playful sensuality. This winter season, try a variety of sweaters and dresses with shoulder and arm cut-outs, including leather and button details.</li><li>Velvet â Velvet adds timeless elegance to any outfit. We especially love velvet in midnight blue.</li><li>Military Chic â A modern twist on olive green and navy blue jackets feature fun details like high collars, structured shoulders, patches, zippers and metallic buttons.</li><li>80âs Fashion â This style is all about volume, bold patterns, bright colours and off-the-shoulder ruffles. Channel your Hilary from Fresh Prince with pointed fuchsia pumps and suit jackets with exaggerated collars and lapels.</li><li>Girlish Shapes â Pleats, ruffles, lace, and translucent overlays abound. This trend looks phenomenal in a long pleated silk skirt, or a sheer updated version of the button-up collared shirt.</li><li>Appliques and Embroidery â The thick textiles of the cold season are just the thing to carry heavier details like appliques and embroidery, in romantic swirling florals, sequins and metallics.</li></ul><h2>Winter Style: Must-have Winter Fashion Accessories</h2><p>During the dark days of winter, you may be tempted to throw on whatever will get you through a rainy day. Spruce up your look by adding these warm and practical accessories. Choose bright, colourful styles to add a pop of colour and upgrade your look in flash.</p><ul><li>Over-Sized Scarf â A big, soft scarf can double as a shawl or a poncho, and a luxurious cashmere blend can be dressed up or down.</li><li>Over-the-Knee Boots â Definitely one of the hottest trends in streetwear right now, namely for their versatility. Try a pair in slate grey or deep terracotta over skinny jeans or leggings.</li><li>Embellished Hair Ties â Chances are, you ditched your scrunchie ages ago. Sleek hair ties of today feature velvet, floral, rhinestones, feathers and sequins.</li><li>Leather â Accessories like industrial style belts, cuffs and chokers give a shoutout to the menswear trend, and provide a classic edge to any day or night fashion.</li><li>Ankle Booties â High-heeled ankle booties with fringe, studs, chains and other metallic details are glamourous and low-key cool.</li><li>Thigh-High Stockings â Make stockings your new cold-weather best friend. Over leggings, tights, jeans or bare legs, these knit socks are charming and feminine.</li><li>Beanies â The beanie is no longer reserved for laid back and punk styles. These oversized knit hats are everywhere, in a variety of shades and styles to complement any outfit and keep your hair climate-controlled.</li></ul><h2>Winter Outfit Ideas</h2><p>On especially cold mornings, it can be super hard to drag yourself out of bed. Combat a case of the blahs by treating your wonderful self. This can take the form of a pear chocolate breakfast muffin with honey butterâ¦ Or an especially cute outfit. Looking good can have a tremendous benefit to your mood, and give you the radiant glow of confidence. Here are some of our favourite styles to look and feel brilliant.</p><ul><li>Pleated Skirt â A pleated skirt, long or short, pairs well with a sweater or cardigan, and can be dressed up or down with sneakers or patent leather sling-backs.</li><li>Classic Sweatshirt â Praise the comfortable cotton crewneck for its moment of versatility in the fashion world. Many new styles incorporate lace and leather details. Wear it with skinny jeans and over-the-knee boots.</li><li>Sweater and Miniskirt â An over-sized knit sweater looks playful and comfortable over a denim, leather or cord miniskirt. Add coloured tights and high-heeled boots for date night or drinks with the girls.</li><li>Night Out â An easy and casual look for dinner and drinks is a fitted mini dress with tights, a moto jacket and a big scarf or shawl. Add a pair of studded ankle booties.</li><li>Athleisure â Thank goodness we can get away with athletic wear outside of the gym. Float from yoga class to brunch in crimson leggings, a slouchy black beanie, stockings, furry boots and a soft grey sweater with shoulder cut-outs.</li><li>Holiday Cocktail Party â A simple velvet minidress in burgundy or midnight blue is adorable and perfect with patterned tights. Pair it with an embellished suit jacket.</li></ul><p>So, this winter, as youâre wrapping twinkle lights around a blue spruce and wondering how to stay warm on your walk to work or night of barhopping, keep our ideas in mind. Honestly, weâre feeling like anything goes and this is no time to play it safe. Whatâs your favourite trend this season and how do you make it yours?</p><p>Featured Photo:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.fi/blogit/julia-toivola/ensilumi\"><strong>Julia Toivola</strong></a> steps out in leather moto pants, vinyl statement booties and a big, soft grey trenchcoat.

Complete your outfit with knee-high boots or chunky heels to elongate your legs. If youâre petite, then try picking a coat that is hip length instead of super long. A short grey coat is also flattering when belted to emphasise your waist. Wear it with a skirt or leather pants; this style will give you an hourglass shape for a gorgeous winter coat outfit.</p><ul><li>Layer a slouchy sweater over a white vest and black leather pants, finish off this look with your long grey coat, a beanie hat and combat boots for a stylish but comfortable outfit.</li><li>For a smart, layered look, opt for a blazer coat and wear it over a turtleneck jumper, cigarette pants and add brogues for a chic Parisian-inspired look.</li><li>If you want to dress up for the evening then layer a slip dress with a long cashmere cardigan and your coat for a sexy but cosy outfit.</li></ul><h2>Add A Pop Of Color</h2><p>When styling your grey winter coat add a pop of color to your outfit to add some vibrancy.

Finish off this outfit with a bright silk scarf, which you could even tie around your bag as seen on Tory Burch t satchel bags and the timeless Hermes Birkin.</li></ul><h2>How To Wear A Grey Overcoat Casually</h2><p>With so many of us living such busy lifestyles itâs essential to find ways to feel comfortable yet confident in your style. Dressing casually is becoming easier, with more women embracing flats rather than heels and jeans instead of skirts.

Its streamlined silhouette is a practical way to look chic and elegant.</li><li>Use different fabrics for winter style with an edge. While it might not keep you warm, a hint of lace or <a href=\"http://www.justthedesign.com/fashion-trends/clothing/style-tips-how-to-wear-velvet/\"><strong>velvet in winter</strong></a> adds a touch of femininity to traditional sweater fabrics: think a lace skirt under a wool sweater.</li></ul><h2>How to Dress for the Cold Fashionably</h2><p>Winter fashion style is all about layers. Not only do they keep you cozy, they also let you experiment with different pieces. Here are a few layering tips to inspire you:</p><ul><li>When it comes to fashion, itâs okay to break the rules. If itâs not too cold, you can play into the current â90s trend by wearing denim on denim. Our favorite tip: try contrasting dark and light colored denim.</li><li>One of 2017âs biggest trends is the turtleneck, and for extra warmth, it pairs well with a chunky sweater. Make sure the turtleneck is slim-fitting to avoid extra bulk.</li><li>Donât be afraid to play with color. Sure, black on black on black matches, but what about different tones of pink or white? A grey sweater under a <a href=\"http://www.justthedesign.com/outfits/winter/style-tips-wear-grey-coat-grey-coat-outfits/\"><strong>grey coat</strong></a> can look particularly elegant. It can also be fun to play with different combinations.</li><li>Layer up in wool or cashmere if you can. They might be more expensive, but theyâre so light and warm they should definitely be on your winter fashion must-have list.</li></ul><h2>Cold Weather Fashion Tips</h2><p>The biggest winter fashion tip is to not forget your accessories. Not only do they stop the warmth from escaping your body, theyâre also a great way to add a pop to your outfit. Here are some of our favorite ways to wear them:</p><ul><li>Hats keep our heads warm, and while a beanie is traditional cold weather gear, you shouldnât be afraid to experiment with other styles. A wool fedora always looks classy, or you could try a baseball cap to add street edge to your winter fashion.</li><li>A statement scarf is an easy way to brighten up a plain winter outfit. Bold patterns, bright colors and cheeky prints are a good place to start.</li><li>Gloves will keep your hands warm, but do you want elegant, â50s-style leather gloves or a more sporty ski style? Either way, they should be an essential part of your outfit.</li><li>Just like a scarf, you can also use your bag to make a quirky fashion statement. Pick something in a contrasting color to make it stand out.</li></ul><p>Whether itâs snowing or just plain cold, we want to know how youâre staying warm.</p><p>Featured Photo: It may be winter in the city, but <a href=\"http://fashionjackson.com/nyfw-winter-in-new-york-city/\"><strong>Amy Jackson</strong></a> knows how to add some warmth, via a rust colored coat.</p><p>Coat: Zara, Sweater: Ann Taylor, Pants: Zara, Booties: H&amp;M, Handbag: Gucci, Sunglasses: Celine.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.justthedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Winter-Outfits-46-564x0.jpg\" alt=\"Helena Glazer is seen here in a pair of striking thigh high boots, worn over skinny denim jeans with a statement belt to create a sexy, chic, winter style.

      "content": "<h2>Should I Wear A Choker?</h2><p>An iconic accessory throughout the ages, chokers bring us visions of Disney princesses and the casual chic of 90âs grunge. Today, weâre seeing countless styles, from the extravagant floral jewels of Oscar de la Renta to the fearless gothic pendants of Fenty x Puma by Rihanna. Whether transforming a simple outfit or adding an elegant detail, this accessory does it all.</p><ul><li>Chokers enhance your natural beauty by accentuating the structure of your jaw, cheeks and collar bones. Experiment with different widths to find the styles to best complement your features.</li><li>Go from office to cocktail hour by layering more mixed-media pieces over your simple black choker.</li><li>Chokers give new life to old treasures from your jewelry box. Layer with other lengths of necklaces or play around by attaching different pendants and charms.</li><li>If youâre a lover of fabrics and textiles, put your own DIY spin on this trend by cutting an old silk scarf lengthwise, or re-fashioning a bandana.</li><li>Embrace the raw crystal and gem trend. Many styles of chokers incorporate crystals, or slide on your own teardrop shaped quartz pendant.</li></ul><h2>What To Wear With A Black Choker</h2><p>A classic black choker is a great place to start, and can easily become your new daily staple. Instantly transform a plain black choker into a high-fashion statement by adding your own pendant. From day to night, we see black chokers in every context. Here are some of our favorites.</p><ul><li>Black Shoelace Choker: Wrapped around two or three times with a small bow, pair the casual black shoelace choker with a stone-washed jean jacket, Vans and a <a href=\"http://www.justthedesign.com/the-plaid-trend-is-everywhere/\"><strong>plaid</strong></a></li><li>Black Velvet Choker: Black velvet turns your party dress into a holiday treat, and looks especially luxurious with jewel tones like emerald or ruby.</li><li>Black and Lavender: Pair a black choker with a breezy blouse in a floral shade of lilac, lavender or orchid. Play up this cool contrast of hard and soft by adding a black <a href=\"http://www.justthedesign.com/rev-up-your-wardrobe-with-these-leather-jacket-outfits/\"><strong>leather jacket</strong></a>.</li><li>Black and White: For a sophisticated and modern look, wear a slim black choker with a creamy ivory blouse or simple white tee.</li></ul><h2>Choker Outfit Ideas</h2><p>No matter your personal style, a choker is sure to complement your coveted wardrobe. The trick is to find the right proportions. During the colder seasons, a thick choker can serve as an extension of your scarf or high-collared jacket or, wear it over a turtleneck. Balance a plunging neckline, deep v-neck or off-the-shoulder blouse with multi-wrap or layered style.</p><ul><li>Layering lots of mixed-media pieces is so trendy right now. Choose pieces with shells, beads and gems to compliment the relaxed sensuality and low neckline of a nude or earth-toned <a href=\"http://www.justthedesign.com/fashion-trends/clothing/wear-slip-dress-trend-confidence/\"><strong>slip dress</strong></a>.</li><li>Large metallic cuff chokers are high-fashion warrior chic. For a night out, couple this bold accessory with a black strapless dress and sleek ponytail.</li><li>A leather belt-style choker is an ultra-modern twist on the utility trend. To streamline this style, take it to the office with a classic button-up shirt, cigarette pants and pumps.</li><li>The scarf-style choker, like weâve seen in Diorâs collection, is super easy to DIY. You can wear these thick or thinâ with ends hidden in the back, knotted and dangling in the front, or in a flirty oversized bow. A lightweight scarf choker looks fresh with a breezy sundress and wedges.</li><li>A faux fur choker adds a dose of luxury to cozy fall and winter styles. Wear a fur choker with a high-necked trench coat, leggings and ballet flats.</li><li>Re-purpose a <a href=\"http://www.justthedesign.com/the-bandana-little-neck-scarf-trend-is-here-outfits-ideas/\"><strong>bandana</strong></a> by tying it around your neck with a cute asymmetrical knot. So bad itâs good, this look is especially cool with a leather jacket, distressed skinny jeans and studded biker boots.</li><li>Feel like a queen in an extravagant diamond choker. These dynamic pieces can be dressed up or down, but we especially like its sophisticated richness with a crisp black blazer and stilettos.</li></ul><p>Whether your agenda includes a museum gallery show or packing a picnic lunch for the park, we hope our ideas will inspire you to incorporate the choker trend into your look.
